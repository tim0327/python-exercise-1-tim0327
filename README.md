## Exercise 1: Basic Variables, Operations, and Functions

**Problem:**
Write a Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and performs the following operations:
- Sum
- Difference
- Product
- Quotient

The program should also include the following:
1. A function called `perform_operations()` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the results of the four operations.
2. A main program that calls this function and prints the results.

**Instructions:**
1. Get two inputs from the user (use `float` for decimal inputs).
2. Define a function `perform_operations(a, b)` that returns the sum, difference, product, and quotient.
3. Call the function and display the results in a clear format.

**Example Output:**

	Enter the first number: 5.5
	Enter the second number: 2
	Sum: 7.5
	Difference: 3.5
	Product: 11.0
	Quotient: 2.75

## Exercise 2: Conditional Statements and Loops

**Problem:**
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks if the number is even or odd.
3. Prints all numbers from 1 up to the entered number, indicating whether each number is even or odd.

**Instructions:**
1. Use an `if` statement to check if the number is even or odd.
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to the input number.
3. Print each number with a label "Even" or "Odd".

**Example Output:**

	Enter a number: 5
	1 Odd
	2 Even
	3 Odd
	4 Even
	5 Odd

## Exercise 3: Compare Two Numbers

**Problem:**
This is a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and determines which one is greater or if they are equal.

**Instructions:**
Write a program that:

1. Takes two numbers as input.
2. Compares them to check which number is greater.
3. Outputs the result:
4. Either which number is greater or
5. If both numbers are equal.
 
**Example Output:**

	Input: 5 and 3
	Output: 5 is greater than 3
	Input: 2 and 7
	Output: 7 is greater than 2
	Input: 4 and 4
	Output: Both numbers are equal
